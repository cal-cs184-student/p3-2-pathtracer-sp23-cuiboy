              <p>For 0 bounce, we only see the light source in the scene, similar to how it was in project 3-1. At 1 bounce, we can observe the specular reflection of the light source from the sphere. Even though there are no glass or mirror material that had been rendered, we can still tell the reflective nature of the spheres right away due to the perfect reflection of the light source without any irradiance falloff.</p>

              <p>For 2 bounces, we can see the light rays that originated from the light source, bounced off the wall and then the back sphere (which has mirror material) before reaching the camera. However, at 2 bounces, the glass sphere still appears dark. When we reach 3 bounces, we can see that the light rays now have enough bounces to make it through the glass material, which require a refraction as it enters the surface and one as it exits.</p>

            Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene `CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae` rendered with $\alpha$ set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between different images. Note that, to change the $\alpha$, just open the .dae file and search for `microfacet`.

        <h3 align="middle">Part 4. Depth of Field</h3>
        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            The pinhole model assumes that light travels in straight lines and that an image is formed by light passing through a small hole or aperture, creating an inverted image on a screen placed behind the hole. The thin lens model, on the other hand, assumes that light passes through a thin, curved lens that bends the light rays and focuses them onto a focal point. In a pin hole model, everything is in focus. However, there is a certain focal length for thin lens models, which more accurately mimics human eye and real-world cameras.
